# Mastering-DSA-in-Java
My personal DSA learning journey in Java. This repo includes solved problems, notes, and implementations of core data structures and algorithms â€” from arrays and linked lists to trees, graphs, and dynamic programming.
Started this repository to motivate myself to stay consistent in practicing Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using Java. It includes daily problem-solving, core concept implementations, and solutions aimed at improving my coding skills and interview preparation.
